# 9-things
9 things I learned about GitHub after becoming a GitHubber

1. Pull Requests are the **start** of a conversation; not a final submission
  - You can have discussions like you have on Issues called **Conversation**
  - You can **comment** on any line and have discussions on that line
	- You can still edit your code submissions to a pull request by updating the branch.

  **DEMO**
  - E.g. https://github.com/saraford/your-moment-of-github-zen/pull/4/files
  - Show associated branch 
	
2. GitHub Keyboard Shortcuts
	
  **DEMO**
  
  - Press '?' 

3. How to not check in your email in your commits (Part 1)

  - First, you'll need to tell **GitHub** to keep your email address private in Settings - Email - Keep my email address private
	- Next, you'll need to tell **Git** to keep your email address private. There are two ways to go about this: First is via Command Line

	**DEMO**
	
  - Go to Settings - Email - Keep my email address private
	- Go to command line and set the `git config --global user.email "username@users.noreply.github.com"`

4. GitHub Desktop (How to not check in your email in comments Part 2)

  - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is your new best friend of the day.
  - it handles 2FA
  - it handles authentication using your favorite shell (cmd, Git Bash, PowerShell) via Git Shell
  - Offers a GUI for github repositories, but you don't have to use it. However, you **do** want to use Git Shell, which opens your favorite shell.
  
  **DEMO**
  
  - Go to Gear - Options to set your email and your shell preference
  - Clone a repo that has branches to see the visualization
